# 🔐 Java Password Manager (AES Encryption)

A simple and secure **Password Manager** built in **Java**, using **AES Encryption** to safely store login credentials in an encrypted file.  
This project is perfect for learning file handling, encryption, OOP concepts, Base64 encoding, and basic CLI application development.

## 🚀 Features

- AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) encryption  
- Store credentials securely  
- Decrypt and view saved passwords  
- Simple and interactive CLI interface  
- Encrypted storage file (`passwords.enc`)  
- Beginner–friendly and easy to extend

## 🧠 How It Works

The project uses:

- **AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding** for encryption  
- **Base64 encoding** to store encrypted bytes as text  
- **File handling** to save and read encrypted data  
- **OOP structure** with separate utility and manager classes  

Passwords never get stored as plain text — only encrypted strings.
